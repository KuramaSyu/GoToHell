### What is this Project and what is it for?

A project, which aims to help me, to make sport while playing games, with the main idea, of
making a specific amount of sport, whenever you die in a game.
The main goal was, to replace a Google Sheet, where we wrote in what sport we did
in what amount. Hence, this projects goal is to not only show you your progress, but also the
progress of your friends
**Important:** Without the discord login, this website is basically useless! I decided to use
Discord, since most people playing games in their leisure time, including me, use it. Hence, I don't need
to think about storing passwords, and I also have access to their Avatars, which make the site more appealing.

**Is it somewhere running?**
Yes, it's currently running here: [gotohell.inu-the-bot.com](https://gotohell.inu-the-bot.com)

### TODO:

#### Done

- [x] make plank formula changeable in settings.
- [x] Games and Sports selectable via a 2-sided drag and drop, so that sorting is also possible. For adding, selecting it should be sufficient

#### Ongoing

- [ ] move API calls to utils/API
- [ ] add functions to these APIs, which only fetch, if zustand store has nothing stored in it

#### Features

- update script: make a backup of db in same folder under backups/iso-date.sql
- Presets, which set plank seconds and multiplier asking the user how many sports he wants to do
- 2 Buttons for Multiplier; one global one local
- box for dragging workouts in. Upload multiple things at once

#### Fixes / QoL

- Number in custom and other inputs has annoying 0 which is not deletable. Maybe accept string, and convert string (use own state here, sync the state with value, and only saveValue or setLiderValue if this new state is a number)
- Show all multipliers in the settings
- some pictures (league ezreal & riven are private)
- ordering for sports does not work

#### Ideas

- [ ] Go Loading icon
- [ ] Linking, who invited who, displaying a tree of all users, showing you, how you probably get here

### Things required to add a game:

- an entry in the default sports in `src/backend/config/default_sports.csv`
- the definition for the frontend in `src/frontend/src/theme/themes.json` in this format:

  ```json
  [
    // example for Teamfight Tactics
    {
      "name": "tft",
      "longName": "Teamfight Tactics",
      "backgrounds": [
        "https://i.postimg.cc/cCc5PpJN/wp7407642-little-legends-wallpapers.jpg",
        "https://i.postimg.cc/k4kdHDQk/teamfight-tactics-galaxies-penguin-featherknight-uhdpaper-com-4-K-7-1270.jpg"
      ]
    },

    // your new game
    {
      "name": "your new game",
      "longName": "the actuall full name",
      "backgrounds": [
        "https://url.to_background_1.png",
        "https://url.to_background_2.png"
      ]
    }
  ];
  ```
