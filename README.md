### What is this Project and what is it for?

A project, which aims to help me, to make sport while playing games, with the main idea, of
making a specific amount of sport, whenever you die in a game.
The main goal was, to replace a Google Sheet, where we wrote in what sport we did
in what amount. Hence, this projects goal is to not only show you your progress, but also the
progress of your friends
**Important:** Without the discord login, this website is basically useless! I decided to use
Discord, since most people playing games in their leisure time, including me, use it. Hence, I don't need
to think about storing passwords, and I also have access to their Avatars, which make the site more appealing.

**Is it somewhere running?**
Yes, it's currently running here: [gotohell.inu-the-bot.com](https://gotohell.inu-the-bot.com)

### TODO:

#### Done

- [x] make plank formula changeable in settings.
- [x] Games and Sports selectable via a 2-sided drag and drop, so that sorting is also possible. For adding, selecting it should be sufficient
- [x] 2 Buttons for Multiplier; one global one local
- [x] Display sports in order

#### Ongoing

- [ ] move API calls to utils/API
  - standard.tsx: DELETE api/sports
  - Sport.tsx: POST api/sports
- [ ] add functions to these APIs, which only fetch, if zustand store has nothing stored in it

#### Features

- [ ] update script: make a backup of db in same folder under backups/iso-date.sql
- [ ] Presets, which set plank seconds and multiplier asking the user how many sports he wants to do
- [ ] box for dragging workouts in. Upl oad multiple things at once
- [ ] Keyboard Shortcuts:
  - ESC to exit settings to /
  - ENTER to upload
  - number, to write into custom
  - letter to start search in sports. If only one sport left, select it. otherwise require enter to select the first one. block during this part the upload enter (a sport needs to be selected anyway). after pressing enter, reset search. when searching, and multile results fould, put enter symbol behind first sport, to indicate, that selection is done with enter. otherwise but the enter symbol infront of the upload symbol. Display a box, when "short search" is used, and how it works. Always.

#### Fixes

- [ ] separate repository for background pictures

#### QoL

- [ ] Show all multipliers in the settings

#### Perf

- [ ] Backend Delete Sport: add userid to db request, instead of making multiple requests

#### Ideas

- [ ] Go Loading icon
- [ ] Linking, who invited who, displaying a tree of all users, showing you, how you probably get here
- [ ] Websocket connection, saying when timeline got an update (api request -> Observer -> listener for ongoing connections (maybe even directly send data?))

### Things required to add a game:

- an entry in the default sports in `src/backend/config/default_sports.csv`
- the definition for the frontend in `src/frontend/src/theme/themes.json` in this format:

  ```json
  [
    // example for Teamfight Tactics
    {
      "name": "tft",
      "longName": "Teamfight Tactics",
      "backgrounds": [
        "https://i.postimg.cc/cCc5PpJN/wp7407642-little-legends-wallpapers.jpg",
        "https://i.postimg.cc/k4kdHDQk/teamfight-tactics-galaxies-penguin-featherknight-uhdpaper-com-4-K-7-1270.jpg"
      ]
    },

    // your new game
    {
      "name": "your new game",
      "longName": "the actuall full name",
      "backgrounds": [
        "https://url.to_background_1.png",
        "https://url.to_background_2.png"
      ]
    }
  ];
  ```
